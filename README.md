Hello! :)

This repo was created as a follow-up to https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g7dq8s/interactive_next_token_selection_from_top_k/ .

Some users requested an app that would allow them to right-click on a token from a generated sequence, select an alternative token, and then automatically generate text starting from that point.

My original intention was to work on this project, but a day later, another LocalLLaMA user posted **exactly** that app: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g83jii/generate_text_with_alternative_words_and .

Therefore, I will no longer be working on this project. Please consider using https://github.com/TC-Zheng/ActuosusAI instead.
